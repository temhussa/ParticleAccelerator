1) Main file which needs to be compiled in order for the simulation to be run is TestParticle.java

2) Current configuration is a cyclotron accelerating a beam of protons non relativistically

3) Average x and y positions of the beam are written to DataOut.txt so this can be imported into qtiplot etc.

4) Was written in the atom text editor so indentation may be off in other editors
